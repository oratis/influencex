## 2026-04-30 — Sprint Q2 cleanup: Redis cache + Vitest + FormField + plugin spec

### Added
- **Redis-backed cache + rate-limit** (Sprint A4): `cache.js` and
  `rate-limit.js` now transparently use Redis when `REDIS_URL` is set, with
  fail-open behavior (any Redis error → behave as if there's no cache so
  business logic keeps running). Companion to the BullMQ queue from A3 —
  flip a single env to make multi-instance Cloud Run safe.
- **`<FormField>` component** (Sprint C5): standardized form-field wrapper
  that auto-wires label `htmlFor`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-invalid`,
  `aria-required`. Eliminates per-page boilerplate and enforces our
  WCAG 2.1 Level A baseline on every form. AuthPage migrated as the
  reference implementation; other pages can adopt incrementally.
- **Frontend test runner** (Sprint C2): Vitest + React Testing Library wired
  in `client/`. 21 component tests cover PasswordInput visibility toggle,
  FormField a11y wiring, OnboardingTour auto-trigger logic +
  localStorage persistence + manual restart event, CommandPalette
  Cmd-K/Ctrl-K hotkey + admin gating + filter behavior. Run with
  `cd client && npm test`.
- **Plugin API spec v0** (`docs/PLUGIN_API_v0.md`, Sprint D4): internal
  contract for `Agent` / `ApifyActor` / `JobHandler` plugin shapes
  to support the upcoming `agents-v2/` → `agents-v3/` refactor without
  breaking external consumers (we have none yet, but the doc fixes the
  shape before we touch it).

### Changed
- `cache.js` and `rate-limit.js` now log which backend they're using at
  boot (`[cache] Using Redis-backed defaultCache` or in-process). No
  behavior change when REDIS_URL is unset.

## 2026-05-01 — Audit hardening

### Fixed
- **Multi-tenant isolation tightened**: every `contacts ↔ kols` JOIN (10 sites) now also matches `kols.workspace_id = contacts.workspace_id`. The hard-bounce blocker no longer counts events across other tenants.
- **Async crash protection**: every `setTimeout(...scrape...)` invocation now has `.catch()` so a scrape failure can never become an unhandled rejection.
- **Invitation token leak risk eliminated**: `invitations.token` is now stored as a sha256 hash. A DB leak can no longer enumerate active invitations. Existing plaintext tokens are auto-hashed on next deploy.
- **Invite code race condition closed**: redemption uses the UPDATE row count as the canonical signal instead of a SELECT-after-UPDATE, which couldn't distinguish a race from a concurrent DELETE.
- **`/api/campaigns` N+1 eliminated**: a single GROUP BY replaces the per-campaign stats query.

### Changed
- **Error responses sanitized in production** (`NODE_ENV=production`): driver text (SQLITE_*, ER_*, "constraint failed", schema hints) is replaced with "Internal error". Sentry still sees the original. Defense-in-depth on the client too: `toastApiError` strips stack-frame-looking strings before showing them.
- **Security headers**: CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, X-Frame-Options, Permissions-Policy, HSTS. Reduces the blast radius of any future XSS.
- **Bcrypt rounds** raised from 10 → 12 for new password hashes (existing hashes still verify; only new/reset passwords pay the cost). Override via `BCRYPT_ROUNDS`.
- **Strict workspace mode** available behind `STRICT_WORKSPACE_SCOPE=true` env var — forces every API call to send `X-Workspace-Id` instead of falling back to the user's default workspace.
- **Image download links in Content Studio** now require an HTTPS host on a known allowlist (Replicate, Fal, Volcengine, etc.) — phishing URLs from a compromised agent are blocked.
- **`deploy.sh` auto-mounts SENTRY_DSN** when the secret exists in Secret Manager — no more "secret created but Cloud Run doesn't see it" gap.

### Added
- `requirePlatformAdmin` middleware extracted from 7 inline `req.user.role !== 'admin'` checks.
- Migration runner now refuses duplicate IDs (catches merge-conflict copy-paste bugs).
- i18n: missing-key warner that logs once per `(lang, key)` pair in dev so typos surface in the console.
- ConfirmDialog/Prompt: focus management — first interactive element auto-focused on open, focus restored to triggering element on close, ESC closes.

## 2026-04-28 — KOL scrape recovery

### Fixed
- **KOL scrape regression**: `scrapeAndEnrichKol` was referencing an undefined `req` after the Apify integration, throwing `ReferenceError` for every KOL added via URL. Existing rows had `scrape_status='error'` and the API status indicator at the top of the KOL Database page showed all-red even when Apify was configured. Both are fixed: scrapes succeed via Apify when MODASH_API_KEY is unset, and the status indicator now reflects Apify availability.

### Added
- **Per-row "Retry scrape" button** on every KOL row in error / partial state — uses the currently-configured API keys.
- **"Retry all failed" bulk button** at the top of KOL Database — re-queues every error/partial row in the workspace (capped at 200, 1s spacer between kicks).
- **`POST /api/kol-database/:id/retry-scrape`** + **`POST /api/kol-database/retry-all`** endpoints, both workspace-scoped.

### Changed
- API status indicator now considers Apify alongside Modash. Tooltip shows which provider is serving each platform (e.g. "instagram via apify" vs "instagram via modash").

---

## 2026-04-28 — Changelog system

### Added
- **/changelog page**: every release shipped to prod is now visible to all users with a "What's new" badge in the sidebar when there are unread entries.
- **Server endpoint** `GET /api/changelog`: parses [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) and returns structured entries — public (no auth) so anyone landing on the site can read release notes.
- **Cmd-K palette** gets a "View changelog" jump.

---

## 2026-04-27 — Apify auto-discovery + cross-entity search

### Added
- **Inbox auto-discovery**: when a workspace has connected Instagram or TikTok via OAuth, the hourly inbox-sync cron now auto-pulls comments from the workspace's own recent posts. No more pasting URLs.
- **Cmd-K command palette** (Ctrl+K on Windows/Linux) searches across pages, KOLs, Contacts, and Campaigns — fuzzy match with keyboard navigation.
- **Reviews → review-miner one-click**: the Reviews dashboard's summary block has a "Run review-miner" button that hands off to the agent with the source pre-filled.
- **Onboarding tour replay**: user menu has a "Replay tour" entry to re-watch the 5-step intro.

### Changed
- AgentsPage now accepts deep-links via `/#/agents?run=<id>&input=<json>` so other pages can hand off pre-filled work.

---

## 2026-04-27 — Observability infrastructure

### Added
- **Sentry error tracking** (Sprint A1): server + client SDKs gated on `SENTRY_DSN` / `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`. Captures unhandled exceptions, attaches `workspace_id` tag and authenticated user. PII-safe (email/id only).
- **OpenTelemetry tracing** (Sprint A2): auto-instruments HTTP, Express, pg, fetch. Gated on `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` so unset = no-op.
- **BullMQ + Redis queue** (Sprint A3+A4): scaffolding ready — flip a single env (`REDIS_URL`) to migrate from in-process queue to Redis-backed, enabling multi-instance Cloud Run.

### Changed
- Bootstrap admin from `ADMIN_EMAIL` env now actually promotes the user to `role='admin'` (was previously a latent bug — user got created but stayed as a regular member).

---

## 2026-04-27 — Reviews + Discovery UI

### Added
- **Reviews dashboard** (`/reviews`): pulls reviews from Steam / App Store / Play Store, classifies sentiment (positive / neutral / negative), shows summary cards + reviews table.
- **Discovery page** (`/discovery`): unified UI for YouTube / Instagram / TikTok / X / Reddit creator discovery. Multi-platform picker, keyword search, real-time job polling, results table.
- **Discovery actions**:
  - **Add selected to campaign** — bulk-imports chosen creators into the active campaign and queues outreach pipeline
  - **Save to KOL Database** — alternative path that stashes candidates without sending emails
  - **Export CSV** — one-click download of the full candidate list
- **Apify Runs admin page** (`/apify-runs`): for platform admins. Lists actor invocations with status filters + reap-stuck-runs button.

### Changed
- Inbox `Sync from Apify` modal — pull comments from any Instagram or TikTok URL into the unified inbox, dedup by external ID.

---

## 2026-04-27 — Apify integration foundation

### Added
- **Multi-platform discovery** (Apify Phase B): Instagram + TikTok + X + Reddit on top of the existing YouTube discovery. Each platform has rule-based scoring + per-workspace daily quota.
- **Profile cache layer**: scraping the same KOL within 7 days now hits the cache, skipping paid Apify calls.
- **Per-workspace cost cap**: a single workspace can no longer drain platform-wide Apify budget. Configurable via `APIFY_WORKSPACE_DAILY_RUN_QUOTA` + `APIFY_WORKSPACE_DAILY_ITEMS_QUOTA`.
- **Failure watchdog**: stuck Apify runs older than 60 minutes get auto-marked `timeout` so they don't pollute quota / status views.
- **Webhook receiver** at `POST /api/webhooks/apify` for async actor mode (skeleton, ready when individual actors switch to async).
- **Actor registry** (`server/apify-actors/`): adding a new Apify actor = drop a single file with `buildInput` + `normalize` functions.

### Changed
- `scraper.js` for Instagram / TikTok now uses Apify when MODASH_API_KEY is unset — no more "MODASH required" errors when only Apify is configured.

---

## 2026-04-27 — Invite codes & onboarding UX

### Added
- **Invite-code registration**: platform admins generate sharable codes (`INFLX-XXXXXXXX`) that anyone can use to register at `/signup`. Multi-use, optional expiry, optional revocation. Distinct from the per-email invitation links — those still work.
- **Forgot-password flow**: standard email + reset-link path with one-time, 1-hour, sha256-hashed tokens. The endpoint always returns 200 (regardless of whether the email exists) to prevent account enumeration.
- **5-step onboarding tour** auto-shows for first-time users with no campaigns. Each step has an optional CTA that dismisses + deep-links to the relevant page.
- **Mobile responsive layout**: <600px viewport collapses the sidebar into a slide-in drawer with hamburger toggle.
- **Smart post-login redirect**: zero campaigns → Conductor (best place to bootstrap a plan); otherwise → Pipeline.
- **Password show/hide toggle** on every auth form.

### Changed
- Login page: "Sign up with invite code" is now a full-width secondary button, not a small link.
- Server auto-creates a default workspace for users who somehow end up without one (orphaned account, deleted workspace) — no more "Workspace context required" dead-end.

## How this file is updated

When you ship a new revision via `./deploy.sh`:

1. Pick a date (most recent at the top) and an optional codename
2. Group changes under **Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed**
3. Write user-facing prose, not commit hashes — readers should understand what changed without git context
4. Push the doc commit alongside the feature commits, OR as a follow-up commit before deploy

The server reads this file at startup and on each `/api/changelog` request (cached 60s in-process). Frontend renders it on `/changelog`.
